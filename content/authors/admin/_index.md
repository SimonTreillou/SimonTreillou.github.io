#    summary: |
#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Baker Coastal Lab at Stanford University, where I study coastal transport and mixing processes with a focus on wave-driven circulation dynamics. I got a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from INSA Toulouse and recently completed my Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography at the University of Toulouse (France) in the LEGOS lab under the supervision of Patrick Marchesiello. My research uses advanced 3D wave-resolving models to improve the understanding of tracer dispersal in nearshore environments, addressing critical environmental challenges such as contaminant mitigation and ecosystem resilience. I hope to integrate numerical modeling, remote sensing, and experimental methods into my work to advance knowledge of coastal physics.
