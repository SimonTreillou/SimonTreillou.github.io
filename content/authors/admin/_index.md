      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Learned:
      - Synthesize your own blockchain solutions
      - Gain an in-depth understanding of the specific mechanics of Bitcoin
      - Understand Bitcoin’s real-life applications and learn how to attack and destroy Bitcoin, Ethereum, smart contracts and Dapps, and alternatives to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Simon Treillou (he/him) is a postdoctoral researcher at the Baker Coastal Lab at Stanford University, where he studies coastal transport and mixing processes with a focus on wave-driven circulation dynamics. He holds a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from INSA Toulouse and recently completed his Ph.D. in Coastal Oceanography at the University of Toulouse (France) in the LEGOS lab under the supervision of Patrick Marchesiello. His research uses advanced 3D wave-resolving models to improve the understanding of tracer dispersal in nearshore environments, addressing critical environmental challenges such as contaminant mitigation and ecosystem resilience. Simon's work will integrate numerical modeling, remote sensing, and experimental methods to advance knowledge of coastal physics.
