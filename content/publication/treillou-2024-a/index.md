abstract: Here we address the problem of coherent interference that arises in double-sum
  wavemakers of wave-resolving models. Identified as a key problem for experimental
  and numerical simulations since the late 1970s, this problem induces spurious persistent
  longshore variability and affects nearshore dynamics. To overcome this problem,
  we present the implementation of a single-sum wavemaker in the 3D wave-resolving
  model CROCO. The new wavemaker, which assigns only one pair of direction and frequency
  values to each component of the wave spectrum, definitively prevents coherent interference,
  unlike a conventional double-sum wavemaker that allows waves of different direction
  to share the same frequency. Each wave component must also strictly comply with
  the periodicity rules, to avoid any spurious boundary dynamics. We validate the
  single-sum wavemaker with experimental data collected in a wave basin with longshore-uniform
  bathymetry and compare results with the double-sum wavemaker simulations. We show
  that the new wavemaker produces transient rips devoid of any coherent interference
  effect and that, consequently, the model statistics closely match the experimental
  data. The new wavemaker therefore guarantees statistical integrity while reducing
  computational costs, a necessary step for realistic wave-resolving studies of nearshore
  dynamics.
