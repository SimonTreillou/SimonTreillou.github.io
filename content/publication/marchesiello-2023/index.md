abstract: We build on the work of Mayer and Madsen (2000) and Larsen and Fuhrman (2018)
  to correct for overmixing in wave potential flow regions due to the linear instability
  of two-equation closure systems. We extend it to the Generic Length Scale (GLS)
  turbulent closure approach, while testing it for the first time on a stratified
  nearshore problem. The modified turbulence equations affect only the nonbreaking
  wave potential flow region where the vorticity is less than 10% of the strain rate
  and thus can preserve stratification on the innershelf under favorable heat and
  wind forcing conditions. This work is a necessary step before engaging in full 3D
  wave-resolving studies of surf--shelf exchange.
