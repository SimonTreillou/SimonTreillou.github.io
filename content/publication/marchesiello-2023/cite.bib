 abstract = {We build on the work of Mayer and Madsen (2000) and Larsen and Fuhrman (2018) to correct for overmixing in wave potential flow regions due to the linear instability of two-equation closure systems. We extend it to the Generic Length Scale (GLS) turbulent closure approach, while testing it for the first time on a stratified nearshore problem. The modified turbulence equations affect only the nonbreaking wave potential flow region where the vorticity is less than 10% of the strain rate and thus can preserve stratification on the innershelf under favorable heat and wind forcing conditions. This work is a necessary step before engaging in full 3D wave-resolving studies of surf--shelf exchange.},
