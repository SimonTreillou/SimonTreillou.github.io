abstract: Abstract The nearshore region, which includes both the surf zone and the
  inner shelf, is a highly dynamic environment where eddies and rip currents of different
  scales coexist and interact. Understanding transport and mixing in this interface
  between land and sea is essential for many reasons, not least to better predict
  the fate of pollutants, fish larvae, and sediments. Previous modeling studies on
  the transport of passive tracers have primarily used depth-averaged Boussinesq models.
  Although these models have provided valuable information, they seem to generally
  underestimate mixing in the surf zone, while they overestimate it on the inner shelf.
  Coastal and Regional Ocean Community (CROCO), a 3D free-surface, wave-resolving
  model, is used here to study the effect of vertical dimension on surfzone eddies
  and nearshore tracer dispersion. The model is applied to both a directional wave
  basin experiment and a large-scale dye release experiment conducted in 2009 at Imperial
  Beach, California. By comparing simulations with and without vertical shear in surfzone
  currents, we isolate various mixing processes, such as shear dispersion, flash rips,
  and mini-rips, recently identified as resulting from undertow vertical shear instability.
  Quantifying each dispersion process in terms of bulk diffusivity reveals the important
  role of vertical shear in weakening flash rips (through a reduction in inverse kinetic
  energy cascade) and hence tracer dispersion offshore, while increasing mixing in
  the surf zone due to mini-rips. This study suggests potential improvements for the
  parameterization of coarser or simpler models to obtain a more accurate representation
  of nearshore transport and dispersion mechanisms. Significance Statement The purpose
  of this study is to investigate the dispersion of tracers (e.g., contaminants, larvae,
  sediments) in the nearshore. We combined laboratory and field experiments with a
  3D wave-resolving model, resulting in a novel view of the physical processes involved,
  to explore the effect of undertow-driven vertical shear. Two main results emerge.
  First, vertical shear reduces stirring by transient rip currents between the surf
  zone and the inner shelf waters. Second, mini-rips (a process resulting from vertical
  shear instability) appear to be the dominant mixing process in the surf zone itself.
  These new results on turbulence and mixing in the nearshore zone call for a reexamination
  of dispersion rates, critical environmental factors, and parameterizations in coarser
  models.
