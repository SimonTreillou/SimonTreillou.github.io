  abstract = {We build on the work of Mayer and Madsen (2000) and Larsen and Fuhrman (2018) to correct for overmixing in wave potential flow regions due to the linear instability of two-equation closure systems. We extend it to the Generic Length Scale (GLS) turbulent closure approach, while testing it for the first time on a stratified nearshore problem. The modified turbulence equations affect only the nonbreaking wave potential flow region where the vorticity is less than 10\% of the strain rate and thus can preserve stratification on the innershelf under favorable heat and wind forcing conditions. This work is a necessary step before engaging in full 3D wave-resolving studies of surf--shelf exchange.},

  abstract = {Here we address the problem of coherent interference that arises in double-sum wavemakers of wave-resolving models. Identified as a key problem for experimental and numerical simulations since the late 1970s, this problem induces spurious persistent longshore variability and affects nearshore dynamics. To overcome this problem, we present the implementation of a single-sum wavemaker in the 3D wave-resolving model CROCO. The new wavemaker, which assigns only one pair of direction and frequency values to each component of the wave spectrum, definitively prevents coherent interference, unlike a conventional double-sum wavemaker that allows waves of different direction to share the same frequency. Each wave component must also strictly comply with the periodicity rules, to avoid any spurious boundary dynamics. We validate the single-sum wavemaker with experimental data collected in a wave basin with longshore-uniform bathymetry and compare results with the double-sum wavemaker simulations. We show that the new wavemaker produces transient rips devoid of any coherent interference effect and that, consequently, the model statistics closely match the experimental data. The new wavemaker therefore guarantees statistical integrity while reducing computational costs, a necessary step for realistic wave-resolving studies of nearshore dynamics.},

  abstract = {Abstract The nearshore region, which includes both the surf zone and the inner shelf, is a highly dynamic environment where eddies and rip currents of different scales coexist and interact. Understanding transport and mixing in this interface between land and sea is essential for many reasons, not least to better predict the fate of pollutants, fish larvae, and sediments. Previous modeling studies on the transport of passive tracers have primarily used depth-averaged Boussinesq models. Although these models have provided valuable information, they seem to generally underestimate mixing in the surf zone, while they overestimate it on the inner shelf. Coastal and Regional Ocean Community (CROCO), a 3D free-surface, wave-resolving model, is used here to study the effect of vertical dimension on surfzone eddies and nearshore tracer dispersion. The model is applied to both a directional wave basin experiment and a large-scale dye release experiment conducted in 2009 at Imperial Beach, California. By comparing simulations with and without vertical shear in surfzone currents, we isolate various mixing processes, such as shear dispersion, flash rips, and mini-rips, recently identified as resulting from undertow vertical shear instability. Quantifying each dispersion process in terms of bulk diffusivity reveals the important role of vertical shear in weakening flash rips (through a reduction in inverse kinetic energy cascade) and hence tracer dispersion offshore, while increasing mixing in the surf zone due to mini-rips. This study suggests potential improvements for the parameterization of coarser or simpler models to obtain a more accurate representation of nearshore transport and dispersion mechanisms. Significance Statement The purpose of this study is to investigate the dispersion of tracers (e.g., contaminants, larvae, sediments) in the nearshore. We combined laboratory and field experiments with a 3D wave-resolving model, resulting in a novel view of the physical processes involved, to explore the effect of undertow-driven vertical shear. Two main results emerge. First, vertical shear reduces stirring by transient rip currents between the surf zone and the inner shelf waters. Second, mini-rips (a process resulting from vertical shear instability) appear to be the dominant mixing process in the surf zone itself. These new results on turbulence and mixing in the nearshore zone call for a reexamination of dispersion rates, critical environmental factors, and parameterizations in coarser models.},

  abstract = {Process-based biophysical models are essential for understanding and predicting plant responses to environment, yet their development and application remains hindered by the ``two-language problem'': models are typically prototyped in interactive, slow languages and then reimplemented in compiled, fast languages for simulation. This workflow requires more human resources, and it may introduce delays, errors, and complexity for model evaluation and prototyping iteration.We present PlantBiophysics.jl, a pure Julia package that unifies model prototyping, calibration, simulation, and evaluation of biophysical models within a single, high-performance and interactive environment. The package currently supports four key processes: light interception, energy balance, photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance. It provides automated model composition and coupling through a modular and extensible architecture. The package supports uncertainty propagation and compatibility with 3D plant structures and dynamic meteorological inputs.We benchmarked PlantBiophysics.jl against the widely used R package plantecophys and the Julia package LeafGasExchange.jl. Simulations ran up to {$\sim$}6700x and {$\sim$}460x faster, respectively, while improving predictive accuracy (e.g., net assimilation nRMSE: 5\% vs. 9\% and 12\%, respectively). By allowing models to be easily swapped, coupled, or extended, and by supporting simulations at scales ranging from single leaves to 3D plant canopies, PlantBiophysics.jl provides a robust, efficient, and transparent tool for plant ecophysiologists and modelers.},
